# 2025 Notes

## Todo

- [ ] proof of concept of addVisionMeasurement()
- [ ] update Rio to 2025 wpilib etc (probably do 2 of 3 for a start)
- [ ] record readings while driving around a camera on a cart, calc stats etc
- [ ] modify drive code to use SimpleMotorFeedforward stuff
- [ ] explore AdvantageKit and possibly adopt their code structure
- [ ] learn to build our own Apriltag FieldLayout (JSON)
- [ ] figure out how to calculate our own robotToCamera Transform3d
- [ ] learn how to convert AprilTag pose stuff to "cameraToObject" for
     the ComputerVisionUtil.objectToRobotPose() call
- [ ] characterize camera parameters/performance
     - frame rate ranges
     - native resolutions
     - native formats
     - configurable parameters available (e.g. exposure time)
- [ ] consider doing camera calibration and using it
- [ ] add Java code to get the Transform3d, but also just add to web dash
- [x] set up Samba share on fire1 (user "user", no password)
- [ ] Java: learn how to receive NT updates (for vision info) on new data
